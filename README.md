## info

We start in Vi mode by default. Use `Ctrl+Shift+/` to toggle it.

In the tables below, `C` and `M` represent `Ctrl` and `Alt` respectively.

With all modes, `Esc` will switch us back normal mode.

We have a choice of visual line and visual block selection. The former is

through `0v$`, saving two strokes over `V`.

Just type slowly. No pressure.

## replace mode

It's insert mode but text gets replaced by directly typing over it.
Also `Backspace` does not delete text here.


## command mode

Orca's [command](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/Orca#commands) mode.

Orca uses `:` as the separator between command and value, but since we preface
`:` is in front of our command for a Vi-esque feel, we use a space as the
separator. For example, `:bpm 80` or `:color ;;ff0`.

Key | Action
----| ------
`Ctrl+U` | Clear current command
`Ctrl+P` | Traverse history backwards
`Ctrl+N` | Traverse history forwards
`ArrowUp` | Traverse history backwards
`ArrowDown` | Traverse history forwards


## find mode

We can use the above bindings from [command mode](#command-mode) to traverse
our search history. In addition, we've also got the following:

Key | Action
----| ------
`n` | Search forward
`N` | Search backward
